==================
Installation notes
==================

radare supports two kind of build systems: ACR and WAF

The WAF build system is supossed to replace the ACR one. But currently both
systems are supported.

ACR is basically a minimalistic replacement of autotools written in shellscript.
You can get more information about it in:

    http://nopcode.org/wk.php/Acr

WAF is a modern work-in-progress python-based build system. Currently both systems are
known to work on most systems, but there are some issues for ACR on Windows, OpenSolaris,
and other proprietary systems. But it should properly work on all Free *nix systems like
GNU/Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD on 32/64 bits.

If you experience any problem building radare. Please ping me to pancake<nopcode.org>
