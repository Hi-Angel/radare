Code injection with radare
==========================

This directory contains different assembly snippets designed
to be injected into child processes to manipulate their
behaviour, get information or take control.

Most of them contain are written between 'pusha/popa'
enclosures to avoid register manipulation after the code
injection and make the child process happy when running
again after the operation.

Remove the pusha/popa opcodes to modify the process registers
after the code injection. Bear in mind that 'pusha/popa' only
stores/restores the general purpose registers, and this can
be br0ken if you make use of the fp, xmm, registers ..

You should use the 'rsc start2bin' program to generate an
hexpair line of bytes containing the opcodes contained in
the _start symbol.

These snippet codes can be used as shellcodes for exploit
development. So, feel free to modify them, create new ones
and send to me these codes to make this collection bigger
supporting multiple architectures and operating systems :)

NOTE: I recommend you to use metasploit or any other software
designed to generate shellcodes for your exploits. radare
doesn't intends to replace them.
