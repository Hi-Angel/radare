Vala frontend for radare
------------------------

This directory contains a native frontend for radare written
in Vala[1] to provide an object oriented and userfriendly API
for easily interfacing to the radare core.

The API will support all the internal and external commands
handled by radare, so it will be possible to write plugins
and wizards with the user in mind.

Dependencies required are the same for building radare but adding:

 - Vala >= 0.1.4
 - Gtk+-2.0
 - Vte


Comments are appreciated.
