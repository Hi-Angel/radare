This directory contains subdirectories with the required APIs
implementing interfaces on top of radare for accessing remote
radares or implementing radare servers (rap://).

There is also a standard API interface providing simpler APIs
for managing the debugger, code analysis, and other.

The idea is to keep all this code as similar as possible to
be able to reconstruct bindings automatically without having
to implement all them all the time.

Current supported bindings are:

  python
    - radare/api
    - radare/remote
    - radare/analysis

  ruby
    - radare/api
    - radare/remote
    - radare/analysis (TODO)

  perl
    - radare/api
    - radare/remote (TODO)
    - radare/analysis (TODO)

The root directory of every language contain example programs
testing the APIs.
