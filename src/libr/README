libr
====

This library is the base for the refactorization of radare into
multiple sub-libraries used by the core.

- libr_asm
  - assemble/disassemble for multiple archs
  - support for endianness
- libr_aca
  - code analysis for various archs
- libr_cons
  - curses replacement
- libr_line
  - readline replacement
- libr_bin
  - elf, pe, ...

All APIs should be prefixed with 'r_' following its lib name:

  f.ex: r_io_open()

The new core will link against all those libraries.
