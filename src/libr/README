  libr - codename 'radare2'
  =========================

LibR is the refactoring of the old radare1 core in a set of libraries
defining the APIs of radare2.

The library 'libr' is composed by different modules, each one implementing
working modules of radare, so then, we get a complete set of libraries for
analyzing code, disassembling bytes, dumping bytes, plugin handling, etc..

The 'R' is for refactoring, reversing, radare, ...

Each module has its own test directory (t/) which contains simple applications
using the upper directory code and linking against the direct dependencies.

This enables a fine-grained test level for checking all functionalities in
one shot and give us the opportunity to write radare2 as test programs.
