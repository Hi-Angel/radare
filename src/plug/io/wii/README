Introduction:
=============

  This plugin allows radare to connect to a Wii directly using
  the USB Gecko gadget and using the libftd2xx for the USB
  communication.

  The server side of radare must run in Wii (or gamecube?).

  Here's the obligatory ascii art:


       ,------ Usb Gecko -------.
      V                         |
      '                         V    ..      Laptop running
    .-G.  Wii console             .-' +\        radare on
    |' "'.       ___           .-'     \\   GNU/Linux or w32
    |  '.,'     /   \          \<    R  \\
    |    || <- |  o._|          \\     .-').
    '.  :||     \__\/            \\ .-'.-'_'|-.
      \ |||                       'o_-.-':'   ."
       \|.'     RadareWiiDaemon     '=_'   .-' 
                                       "--'

  1) Boot the RadareWiiDaemon DOL into the Wii

  2) Connect the USB Gecko to the Wii and the terminal

  3) Start radare from dah shell:

     > open the ram
     $ radare wii://ram

     > open video ram (can perform screenshots :)
     $ radare wii://vram

     > open the nand for reading and writing
     $ radare -w wii://nand

     > start debugger
     $ radare wii://dbg



Internally:
===========

 Source is found at src/plugins/wii directory.

 Native wii code is under the ppc/ directory.
  - code for read/write nand
  - code to manage usb communications

 UsbGecko uses the libftd2xx library to get a serial
 console via usb to the gadget from the pc.

 This library is proprietary. But there are blobs:

    http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/Linux/libftd2xx0.4.13.tar.gz

 This is the userland 'driver' for communicating with the gecko card
 and get a serial line.

 Wii plugin uses the Gecko api that uses the FTd2xx driver

 The radre wii daemon is a piece of code that is compiled into a
 DOL binary that can be booted via CD and USB.

 The daemon waits for commands commands in the protocol specified
 in remote.c, that allows to wrap all basic IO and system() via
 serial line (socket, serial port, usb, etc..)

 Would be really cool if we were able to handle the native Gecko commands,
 but seems there is no specification for this protocol and only GeckoTool
 can be used ...



Current state
=============

  Not yet working, just a big puzzle of little pieces.
