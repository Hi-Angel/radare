Process to Filedescriptor library
=================================

This library allows you to open processes like if they where plain files
and debug them via the system() interface.

Use ./configure --with-debugger to build this library layer.


Proposed syntax for process file handling
=========================================

  dbg:///bin/ls
  pid://19433
  w32dbg://c:\windows\notepad.exe


KNOWN BUGS
==========
ATM there's no BSD or non-x86 port. So, i'm implementing an abstraction
layer to provide this support.
