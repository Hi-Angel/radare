dtdumper v0.1.3
---------------

- This is a small utility to dump your GDT, LDT and IDT tables and print descriptors
- Use make obsd on bsds systems
- This userland version will not work with VMware/Xen/Kqemu running on a non VT-able
  processor but should print out your VMware/Xen/Kqemu version. If not, please help me
  to fill the database and send me an e-mail ;)
- Some privileges are needed if you intend to dump some table. Getting the
  tables' addresses or detecting VMware/Xen/Kqemu does'nt require any privilege.
