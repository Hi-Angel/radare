.Sh NAME
.Nm radiff
.Nd Unified binary diffing utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm radiff
.Op -cbgeirp
.Op -f [from]
.Op -t [to]
.Op file.a
.Op file.b
.Sh DESCRIPTION
radiff implements some binary diffing algorithms.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl b
Use bytediff (byte-per-byte binary diffing between two target files), this is the faster way to do it, but it will not handle byte insertion or offset displacements.
.It Fl c
Show output in disassembly format with delta offset support.
.It Fl d
Use the GNU diff as backend (slow, but really good output)
.It Fl e
Use the erg0ts generic c++ implementation of bindiff.
.It Fl n
Display only the number of differences found.
.It Fl r
Display results as radare commands (used to generate binary patch files)
.It Fl s
Use rsc symdiff to find differences at symbol level (support delta diffing)
.It Fl S
Use rsc symbytediff to find differences at symbol level using a byte-per-byte binary comparision algorithm.
.It Fl p
Perform a diff between two RDB files (radare databases) these files can be generated from radare using the code analysis commands, or from IDA using the ida2rdb.idc script)
.It Fl f [from]
Define from address (start looking for differences at offset 'from'
.It Fl t [to]
Define end address (stop binary diffing at offset 'to'
.It Fl h
Show usage help message.
