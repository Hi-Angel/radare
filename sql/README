sql and radare
==============

Radare can make use of a SQL database to store and manage information about the process.

The main idea is to have a (shared?) database where multiple users can work together
sharing label, comments and more information between multiple radare sessions when
debugging a process.

These tables should be generated on a sqlite (at the moment) database.

This is just a proof of concept, so, I don't expect having sql support for radare
until 0.9 or more.
